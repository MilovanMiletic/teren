# Teren — Roadmap

Milestones and the increment sequence. `PROJECT.md` says *why*; this file says *in what order*.
Technical detail lives in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Status legend: ☐ not started · ◐ in progress · ☑ done · ⏸ blocked (reason given)
`[F]` = requires founder hours (nobody else can do it).

Last updated: 2026-08-29.

## How we work

- **Increment = one reviewable unit.** Each has a "done when" the founder can verify in one
  evening without reading every line of code. Nothing merges half-finished.
- **Two tracks run in parallel:** Track A de-risks the product (transcription), Track B builds
  the money path. Track A is founder-blocked on real audio; Track B never waits for it, because
  transcription sits behind an interface from day one.
- **Main is always demo-ready** (PROJECT.md principle 7). From B7 onward, every merge is
  something the distributor could show on his phone.
- **Order is risk-first, not feature-first.** The things that can kill the product get answered
  before the things that make it pretty.

## Milestone 0 — Demo-ready (the money path)

**Goal:** the distributor can pull out his phone and show: speak → structured entry → PDF report.
**Done when:** M0 demo runs end to end on a real phone, with seeded Serbian demo data, without
the founder touching a terminal.

### Track A — transcription risk

| #   | Increment                      | Done when                                                                                                                                                  | Notes                                                                             |
| --- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A1  | ☐ STT spike harness            | `dotnet run --project tools/SttSpike -- sample.ogg` prints side-by-side transcripts from every configured provider                                         | Throwaway console app; no product code depends on it                              |
| A2  | ☐ `[F]` Record real site audio | 3–5 voice notes from an actual site, Opus/OGG mono 16 kHz, with noise and trade jargon                                                                     | **The single most valuable founder hour in the project**                          |
| A3  | ☐ STT provider decision        | `docs/stt-evaluation.md` compares providers on the words that matter (work items, quantities, names); one provider chosen, decision recorded in PROJECT.md | If nothing is good enough → product pivot discussion, better now than in week six |

### Track B — money path

| #   | Increment                     | Done when                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Depends on                                              |
| --- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| B0  | ☑ Repo + dev environment      | Done 2026-08-29 — git repo, .NET 10 solution (Api/Core/Infrastructure), Angular 22 PWA with Transloco (`sr` default, `en` switchable), Postgres + MinIO via compose, `/health` endpoint, README. **Outstanding:** HTTPS tunnel for phone testing still to be set up (needs the founder's ngrok signup) | —                                                       |
| B1  | ☑ Data model + seed           | Done 2026-08-29 — EF `InitialSchema` migration (company/project/entry/media/report, snake_case, check constraints), immutability triggers verified against live UPDATE/DELETE, tenant query filters (deny-by-default), idempotent Serbian demo seed via `dotnet run --project src/Teren.Api -- seed` | B0                                                      |
| B2  | ☑ Capture flow (offline-only) | Done 2026-08-29 (incl. adversarial review + 10 fixes, then the adaptive-layout rework — app header ≥768, global language switcher, three device classes, founder-approved): Home/Recording/Saved/Pending, Dexie v2 with per-second chunk persistence and orphan rescue, photo pipeline (GPS-before-compression), full sr/en i18n, offline-cached dictionaries. 91 specs green at 390/768/834/1280/1920. **Real-device checks (mic, offline cold-start, iOS) still owed — needs the HTTPS tunnel.** Delta-review verdict pending | B0                                                      |
| B3  | ◐ Upload path                 | **Server side done 2026-08-29** (incl. adversarial review + 7 fixes): idempotent POST /entries, presigned PUTs, sealed-evidence /complete with pending/failed distinction, media caps, storage time-budget → 503, static-token auth. **Remaining: wire the PWA outbox to the API** (upload loop, retry/backoff, confirmed_by_server) | B1, B2                                                  |
| B3a | ☐ Staging environment         | The stack runs continuously on a small VPS at a stable HTTPS origin; founder tests from his phone without the founder's laptop being on; deploy is one command                                                              | B3                                                      |
| B4  | ☐ Processing pipeline         | Hangfire job takes an uploaded entry through STT → Claude extraction → `awaiting_confirmation` with structured JSON populated                                                                                               | B3a; STT provider from A3 (interface stubbed until then) |
| B5  | ☐ Confirmation screen         | Shows what the system understood (Serbian by default, English switchable); corrections save as (transcript, extracted, corrected) triples; entry → `confirmed`                                                              | B4                                                      |
| B6  | ☐ PDF + email                 | A confirmed entry produces a PDF in the project's language that lands in a real inbox                                                                                                                                       | B5                                                      |
| B7  | ☐ Demo polish                 | Teren branding, installable on the distributor's phone (A2HS), seeded demo project that always looks good, one-page demo script                                                                                             | B6                                                      |

**M0 founder actions:** A2 (record audio), Serbian copy review at B5 (trade vocabulary needs a
native ear, not just correct grammar), B7 review on a real phone.

**Testing rhythm:** every increment from B0 onward is verifiable on the founder's own phone, not
just in a desktop browser. This is not a nicety — voice recording, camera, GPS, offline behaviour
and install-to-home-screen all require a real device on a secure (HTTPS) origin, and none of them
can be judged from a laptop. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` §13 for the three environments.

## Milestone 1 — Pilot-ready

**Goal:** one real foreman can use it daily on a real site.
**Done when:** PROJECT.md Phase 1 test starts running — one foreman, three weeks, unreminded.

| #   | Increment                    | Done when                                                                                                                                         |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C1  | ☐ Offline queue hardening    | Entries survive airplane mode, app kill, and flaky signal; "N pending" always visible; upload resumes on next open                                |
| C2  | ☐ Weather enrichment         | Entry auto-carries conditions and temperature for its date and GPS location                                                                       |
| C3  | ☐ Archive view               | List and open past entries by project and date, with photos and transcript                                                                        |
| C4  | ☐ Immutability + corrections | Reported entries cannot change; a correction creates a new entry via `supersedes_entry_id`                                                        |
| C5  | ☐ Device binding             | A join code binds a phone to a project — no login screen, no hardcoded project                                                                    |
| C6  | ☐ Weekly recap               | Weekly PDF summarising the week's entries                                                                                                         |
| C7  | ☐ Production deploy          | Running on Hetzner with TLS, automated Postgres backups, error alerting                                                                           |
| C8  | ☐ `[F]` Pilot onboarding     | A foreman from the distributor's network has it installed, understands it in under five minutes, and the founder has a channel for his complaints |

---

## Milestone 2 — Sellable

**Goal:** it can be sold to someone the founder has never met.

- ☐ Accounts, companies, roles (owner / foreman), multi-project
- ☐ Client-facing web view of a project's diary (the thing that stops the client phoning)
- ☐ Billing and subscription per site
- ☐ Per-trade entry templates and report layouts (plumbing/heating first)
- ☐ Legal-diary research outcome applied (compliance mode or explicit "evidence, not the legal diary" positioning)
- ☐ Serbian-language onboarding material for the distributor

---

## Milestone 3 — Repeatable

- ☐ Second vertical (electricians, then general builders)
- ☐ Self-serve signup and trial
- ☐ Quality loop from correction triples driving prompt and vocabulary improvements
- ☐ Native shell — only if PWA limits actually block real users

---

## Deliberately not building yet

Scheduling, quoting/invoicing, chat, worker time-tracking, BIM/drawing integration, an offline map,
Android/iOS native apps, anything multi-language beyond Serbian. Each one is a real product on its
own; none of them is why a contractor would pay in month one.

---

## Critical path and blockers

```
A1 ──► A2 [F] ──► A3 ──┐
                       ├──► B4 ──► B5 ──► B6 ──► B7 ──► M0 demo
B0 ──► B1 ──► B3 ──────┘
  └──► B2 ──────┘
```

- **Only A2 can stall the project**, and only the founder can clear it. Everything on Track B
  proceeds without it.
- If A3 concludes Serbian STT is not usable on site audio, stop and rethink the input method
  (typed shorthand + photos) before B4 — do not build the pipeline around a broken assumption.

## Open decisions blocking later work

| Decision                                        | Needed by | Recommendation                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email delivery provider                         | B6        | Resend or Postmark — both give clean DKIM/SPF setup on a `.rs` domain |
| STT provider                                    | B4        | Decided by A3, not by opinion                                         |
| Legal status of electronic site diary in Serbia | M2        | Research task, ~1 day, Claude can do it                               |
